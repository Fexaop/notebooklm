  "content": "In the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electric currents produce magnetic fields. This discovery, which was made in the early part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot and Savart, among others.\n\nIn the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism as a subject in its own right.\n\nSome of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:",
