  "content": "Some of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:\n\n(i) The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointing approximately from the geographic south to the north.\n\n(ii) When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in the north-south direction. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the north pole and the tip which points to the geographic south is called the south pole of the magnet.",
