  "content": "(iii) There is a repulsive force when north poles ( or south poles ) of two magnets are brought close together.\n\nConversely, there is an attractive force between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of the other.\n\n(iv) We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet.\n\nIf a bar magnet is broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with somewhat weaker properties.\n\nUnlike electric charges, isolated magnetic north and south poles known as magnetic monopoles do not exist.",
