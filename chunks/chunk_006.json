  "content": "Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic north and south poles known as magnetic monopoles do not exist.\n\n(v) It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.\n\nWe begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an external magnetic field. We describe Gauss's law of magnetism. We next describe how materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic properties. We describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism.",
