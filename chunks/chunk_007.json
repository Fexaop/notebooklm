  "content": "We begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an external magnetic field. We describe Gauss's law of magnetism. We next describe how materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic properties. We describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism.\n\n# 5.2 THE BAR MAGNET\n\nWe begin our study by examining iron filings sprinkled on a sheet of glass placed over a short bar magnet. The arrangement of iron filings is shown in Fig. 5.1.\n\nThe pattern of iron filings suggests that the magnet has two poles similar to the positive and negative charge of an electric dipole. As mentioned in the introductory section, one pole is designated the North pole and the other, the South pole. When suspended freely, these poles point approximately towards the geographic north and south poles, respectively. A similar pattern of iron filings is observed around a current carrying solenoid.",
