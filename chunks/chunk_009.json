Taking the constant of integration to be zero means fixing the zero of potential energy at  $\\theta = 90^{\\circ}$ , i.e., when the needle is perpendicular to the field. Equation (5.3) shows that potential energy is minimum  $(= -m\\mathrm{B})$  at  $\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$  (most stable position) and maximum  $(= +m\\mathrm{B})$  at  $\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$  (most unstable position).",

  "summary": "This chunk explains that the magnetic potential energy U_{m} can be obtained through an expression based on the 'restoring torque' and angle 'theta' between vectors 'm' and 'B'.\n  The potential energy is represented by the formula U_{m} = -mB*cos(theta), where U_{m} is the magnetic potential energy, 'm' is the magnetic moment, 'B' is magnetic field, and 'theta' is the angle between 'm' and 'B'.",
