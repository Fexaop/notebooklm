This is unlike the electric dipole where these field lines begin from a positive charge and end on the negative charge or escape to infinity.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](images/image_1_0.jpeg)\nFIGURE 5.1 The arrangement of iron filings surrounding a bar magnet. The pattern mimics magnetic field lines. The pattern suggests that the bar magnet is a magnetic dipole.",
