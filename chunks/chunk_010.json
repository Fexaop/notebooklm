  "content": "We have emphasised in Chapter 2 that the zero of potential energy can be fixed at one's convenience. Taking the constant of integration to be zero means fixing the zero of potential energy at  $\\theta = 90^{\\circ}$ , i.e., when the needle is perpendicular to the field. Equation (5.3) shows that potential energy is minimum  $(= -m\\mathrm{B})$  at  $\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$  (most stable position) and maximum  $(= +m\\mathrm{B})$  at  $\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$  (most unstable position).\n\n## Example 5.1",
