An iron nail near a bar magnet, however, experiences a force of attraction in addition to a torque. Why?\n\n(c) Must every magnetic configuration have a north pole and a south pole? What about the field due to a toroid?\n(d) Two identical looking iron bars A and B are given, one of which is definitely known to be magnetised. (We do not know which one.) How would one ascertain whether or not both are magnetised? If only one is magnetised, how does one ascertain which one? [Use nothing else but the bars A and B.]",
