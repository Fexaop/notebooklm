(b) A magnetic needle in a uniform magnetic field B. The arrangement may be used to determine either B or the magnetic moment m of the needle.\n\n(ii) The tangent to the field line at a given point represents the direction of the net magnetic field B at that point.\n(iii) The larger the number of field lines crossing per unit area, the stronger is the magnitude of the magnetic field B. In Fig. 5.2(a), B is larger around region ii than in region ①.\n(iv) The magnetic field lines do not intersect, for if they did, the direction of the magnetic field would not be unique at the point of intersection.\n\nOne can plot the magnetic field lines in a variety of ways. One way is to place a small magnetic compass needle at various positions and note its orientation. This gives us an idea of the magnetic field direction at various points in space.",
