  "content": "One can plot the magnetic field lines in a variety of ways. One way is to place a small magnetic compass needle at various positions and note its orientation. This gives us an idea of the magnetic field direction at various points in space.\n\n# 5.2.2 Bar magnet as an equivalent solenoid\n\nIn the previous chapter, we have explained how a current loop acts as a magnetic dipole (Section 4.9). We mentioned Ampere's hypothesis that all magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of circulating currents.",
