We mentioned Ampere's hypothesis that all magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of circulating currents.\n\nThe resemblance of magnetic field lines for a bar magnet and a solenoid suggest that a bar magnet may be thought of as a large number of circulating currents in analogy with a solenoid.",

  "summary": "This chapter discusses the analogy between a bar magnetic and a solenoid, in which the magnetic field lines resemble those of a solenoid flowing rings very small and tending to aggregate, forming in them large loops whose distribution is symmetric from the point of view of the longitude around the polar axis. The resemblance of the magnetic field lines of a solenoid and a bar magnet allows us to think of a bar magnet as a large number of circulating currents in analogy with a solenoid.",
