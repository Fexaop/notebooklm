  "content": "One can test this analogy by moving a small compass needle in the neighbourhood of a bar magnet and a current-carrying finite solenoid and noting that the deflections of the needle are similar in both cases.\n\nTo make this analogy more firm we may calculate the axial field of a finite solenoid depicted in Fig. 5.3 (a). We can demonstrate that at large distances this axial field resembles that of a bar magnet.",
