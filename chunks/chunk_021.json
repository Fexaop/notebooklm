  "content": "This is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one may obtain experimentally. Thus, a bar magnet and a solenoid produce similar magnetic fields. The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal to the magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the same magnetic field.\n\n## 5.2.3 The dipole in a uniform magnetic field\n\nLet's place a small compass needle of known magnetic moment  $\\mathbf{m}$  allowing it to oscillate in the magnetic field. This arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.3(b).",
