  "content": "Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777 - 1855) He was a child prodigy and was gifted in mathematics, physics, engineering, astronomy and even land surveying. The properties of numbers fascinated him, and in his work he anticipated major mathematical development of later times. Along with Wilhelm Welser, he built the first electric telegraph in 1833. His mathematical theory of curved surface laid the foundation for the later work of Riemann.\n\n# 5.3 MAGNETISM AND GAUSS'S LAW\n\nIn Chapter 1, we studied Gauss's law for electrostatics. In Fig 5.2(c), we see that for a closed surface represented by ①, the number of lines leaving the surface is equal to the number of lines entering it. This is consistent with the fact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However, in the same figure, for the closed surface ①, there is a net outward flux, since it does include a net (positive) charge.\n\nThe situation is radically different for magnetic fields which are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the Gaussian surfaces represented by ① or ① in Fig 5.2(a) or Fig. 5.2(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the number of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is balanced by the number of lines entering it. The net magnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces. This is true for any closed surface.",

  "summary": "Karl Friedrich Gauss (1877-1855) was a highly gifted polymath who made pioneering contributions to mathematics, physics, engineering, astronomy, and surveying. He anticipated important later mathematical developments and contributed to the early development of electromagnetism. Gauss's magnetic theory laid the groundwork for Riemann's work on curved surfaces. He is known for Gauss's law for electrostatics, linear electric field with two point charges, Coulomb's law, and derivatives of electric potential at the surface of a Gaussian surface.",
