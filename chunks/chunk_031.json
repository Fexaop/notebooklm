  "content": "In a bar magnet the intensity of the magnetic field is the strongest at the two ends (poles) and weakest at the central region.\n\nThis fact may be used to determine whether A or B is the magnet.\n\nIn this case, to see which one of the two bars is a magnet, pick up one, (say, A) and lower one of its ends; first on one of the ends of the other (say, B), and then on the middle of B.\n\nIf you notice that in the middle of B, A experiences no force, then B is magnetised.\n\nIf you do not notice any change from the end to the middle of B, then A is magnetised.",
