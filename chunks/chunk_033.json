  "summary": "The text is a short passage about the relationship between the electrostatic analog and the magnetic field around a bar magnet at a distance r, where r is much greater than the size of the magnet. The passage also mentions that the constant $1:4 * pi * epsilon_0$ is equal to the constant $mu_0:4 * pi$.",
