  "summary": "In the context of a bar magnet, for distances r that are much greater than the length l of the magnet, the equatorial field (B_E) can be mathematically described by the equation B_E = - (mu_0 * mathbf{m}) / (4 pi * r^3), while the axial field (B_A) can be expressed as B_A = -(mu_0 * mathbf{m}) / (4 pi * r^3).",
