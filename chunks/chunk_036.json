  "content": "(d) Magnetic field arises due to charges in motion. Can a system have magnetic moments even though its net charge is zero?\n\n## Solution\n\n(a) No. The magnetic force is always normal to $\\mathbf{B}$ (remember magnetic force $= q\\mathbf{v} \\quad \\mathbf{B}$). It is misleading to call magnetic field lines as lines of force.\n(b) Gauss's law of magnetism states that the flux of $\\mathbf{B}$ through any closed surface is always zero $\\int_{S} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{s} = 0$.\n\nIf monopoles existed, the right hand side would be equal to the monopole (magnetic charge) $q_{m}$ enclosed by S. [Analogous to Gauss's law of electrostatics, $\\int_{S} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{s} = \\mu_{0} q_{m}$ where $q_{m}$ is the (monopole) magnetic charge enclosed by S.]",
