  "content": "If the interior of the solenoid is filled with a material with non-zero magnetisation, the field inside the solenoid will be greater than $\\mathbf{B}_0$. The net $\\mathbf{B}$ field in the interior of the solenoid may be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{B}_{0} + \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\tag{5.9}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the field contributed by the material core. It turns out that this additional field $\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is proportional to the magnetisation $\\mathbf{M}$ of the material and is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\mathbf {B} _ {\\mathrm {m}} = \\mu_ {0} \\mathbf {M} \\tag {5.10}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the same constant (permittivity of vacuum) that appears in Biot-Savart's law.",
