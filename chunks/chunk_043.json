  "content": "$$\n\\mu = \\mu_ {0} \\mu_ {r} = \\mu_ {0} (1 + \\chi).\n$$\n\nThe three quantities $\\chi$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{r}}$ and $\\mu$ are interrelated and only one of them is independent. Given one, the other two may be easily determined.\n\n# Solution\n\n(a) The field  $H$  is dependent of the material of the core, and is  $H = nI = 1000 \\times 2.0 = 2 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{~A/m}$ .\n(b) The magnetic field  $B$  is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} B = \\mu_ {r} \\mu_ {0} \\mathrm {H} \\\\ = 4 0 0 \\times 4 \\pi \\times 1 0 ^ {- 7} (\\mathrm {N} / \\mathrm {A} ^ {2}) \\times 2 \\times 1 0 ^ {3} (\\mathrm {A} / \\mathrm {m}) \\\\ = 1. 0 \\mathrm {T} \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$\n\n(c) Magnetisation is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} M = (B - \\mu_ {0} H) / \\mu_ {0} \\\\ = \\left(\\mu_ {r} \\mu_ {0} H - \\mu_ {0} H\\right) / \\mu_ {0} = \\left(\\mu_ {r} - 1\\right) H = 3 9 9 \\times H \\\\ \\cong 8 \\times 1 0 ^ {5} \\mathrm {A / m} \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$\n\n(d) The magnetising current  $I_{M}$  is the additional current that needs to be passed through the windings of the solenoid in the absence of the core which would give a  $B$  value as in the presence of the core. Thus  $B = \\mu_r n (I + I_M)$ . Using  $I = 2\\mathrm{A}$ ,  $B = 1\\mathrm{T}$ , we get  $I_{M} = 794\\mathrm{A}$ .",
