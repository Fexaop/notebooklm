  "content": "The situation is radically different for magnetic fields which are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the Gaussian surfaces represented by ① or ① in Fig 5.2(a) or Fig. 5.2(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the number of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is balanced by the number of lines entering it. The net magnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces. This is true for any closed surface.\n\n![img-8.jpeg](images/image_6_8.jpeg)\nFIGURE 5.5",
