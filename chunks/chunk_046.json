  "content": "Figure 5.7(a) shows a bar of diamagnetic material placed in an external magnetic field. The field lines are repelled or expelled and the field inside the material is reduced. In most cases, this reduction is slight, being one part in  $10^{5}$ . When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from high to low field.\n\n![img-16.jpeg](images/image_11_16.jpeg)\n(a)",
