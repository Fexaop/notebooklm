The magnetic flux through  $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\mathbf{S}$  is defined as  $\\Delta \\phi_{B} = \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{S}$ , where  $\\mathbf{B}$  is the field at  $\\Delta \\mathbf{S}$ . We divide  $S$  into many small area elements and calculate the individual flux through each. Then, the net flux  $\\phi_{B}$  is,\n\n$$\n\\phi_ {B} = \\sum_ {\\text {a l l}} \\Delta \\phi_ {B} = \\sum_ {\\text {a l l}} \\mathbf {B}. \\Delta \\mathbf {S} = 0 \\tag {5.6}\n$$\n\nwhere 'all' stands for 'all area elements  $\\Delta \\mathbf{S}$ '. Compare this with the Gauss's law of electrostatics. The flux through a closed surface in that case is given by\n\n$$\n\\sum \\mathbf {E}. \\Delta \\mathbf {S} = \\frac {q}{\\varepsilon_ {0}}\n$$\n\nwhere  $q$  is the electric charge enclosed by the surface.",
