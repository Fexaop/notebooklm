There are no sources or sinks of B; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop. All magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement of dipoles and/or current loops.",

  "summary": "Magnetism is a fundamental force of nature that produces magnetic fields from moving electric charges or magnetic dipoles. It is described by Gauss's Law for Magnetism, which states that the net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero. Gauss's Law for Magnetism implies that magnetic field lines must form closed loops, and that magnetic monopoles do not exist.",
