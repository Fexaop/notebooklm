  "summary": "When a magnetic field is applied to a diamagnetic substance, the electrons with orbital magnetic moments in the same direction slow down while those with the opposite direction speed up. This induces a current according to Lenz's law, causing the substance to develop a net magnetic moment in the opposite direction of the applied field, resulting in repulsion.",
