  "content": "Superconducting magnets can be gainfully exploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically levitated superfast trains.\n\n### 5.5.2 Paramagnetism\n\nParamagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e. they get weakly attracted to a magnet.\n\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material possess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own.\n\nOn account of the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation is seen.\n\nIn the presence of an external field B_{0}, which is strong enough, and at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be made to align and point in the same direction as B_{0}.\n\nFigure 5.7(b) shows a bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field.\n\nThe field lines gets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced.",
