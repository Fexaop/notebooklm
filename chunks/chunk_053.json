  "content": "The field lines gets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced.\n\nIn most cases, this enhancement is slight, being one part in 10^{5}.\n\nWhen placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from weak field to strong.\n\nSome paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium, oxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. For a paramagnetic material both χ and μ_{r} depend not only on the material, but also (in a simple fashion) on the sample temperature. As the field is increased or the temperature is lowered, the magnetisation increases until it reaches the saturation value at which point all the dipoles are perfectly aligned with the field.\n# Magnetism and Matter\n\n# 5.5.3 Ferromagnetism\n\nFerromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field. They have strong tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get strongly attracted to a magnet.\n\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material possess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material.\n\nHowever, they interact with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align themselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called domain.",
