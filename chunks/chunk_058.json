  "content": "We may wonder as to what happens when the external field is removed.\n\nIn some ferromagnetic materials the magnetisation persists.\n\nSuch materials are called hard magnetic materials or hard ferromagnets.\n\nAlnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt and copper, is one such material.\n\nThe naturally occurring lodestone is another.\n\nSuch materials form permanent magnets to be used among other things as a compass needle.",
