  "content": "There are a number of elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, etc.\n\nThe relative magnetic permeability is  $>1000$ !\n\nThe ferromagnetic property depends on temperature. At high enough temperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet. The domain structure disintegrates with temperature. This disappearance of magnetisation with temperature is gradual.",
