Magnetic poles cannot be isolated.\n\n2. When a bar magnet of dipole moment $\\mathbf{m}$ is placed in a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$,\n\n(a) the force on it is zero,\n(b) the torque on it is $\\mathbf{m} \\times \\mathbf{B}$,\n(c) its potential energy is $-\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$, where we choose the zero of energy at the orientation when $\\mathbf{m}$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$.",
