  "summary": "The text primarily demonstrates the use of vector field analysis to characterize magnetic monopoles specifically through three axis-aligned problems (abscissa, ordinate, and transverse) and the absence of magnetic charge, wherein Gauss’s magnetic flux theorem confirms the net magnetic flux through any closed surface being zero",

    "What happens to the magnetic field when a magnetic charge is introduced?",
