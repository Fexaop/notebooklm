Consider a material placed in an external magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0$. The magnetic intensity is defined as,\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0}{\\mu_0}\n$$\n\nThe magnetisation $\\mathbf{M}$ of the material is its dipole moment per unit volume. The magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ in the material is,\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 (\\mathbf{H} + \\mathbf{M})\n$$\n\n6. For a linear material $\\mathbf{M} = \\chi \\mathbf{H}$. So that $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H}$ and $\\chi$ is called the magnetic susceptibility of the material. The three quantities, $\\chi$, the relative magnetic permeability $\\mu_r$, and the magnetic permeability $\\mu$ are related as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mu = \\mu_0 \\mu_r\n$$\n\n$$\n\\mu_r = 1 + \\chi\n$$\n\n7. Magnetic materials are broadly classified as: diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic. For diamagnetic materials $\\chi$ is negative and small and for paramagnetic materials it is positive and small. Ferromagnetic materials have large $\\chi$.\n\n8. Substances, which at room temperature, retain their ferromagnetic property for a long period of time are called permanent magnets.",
