  "summary": "Biot-Savart's law describes the magnetic field (φb) as $$\\u03C6b = \\frac{φφ}{4\\pi r^3} τ$$ where φ is the current density and r is the radius vector. According to Ampère's law, there is a circular magnetic field (φb) with a radius of \\rho meters and a current of I amperes flowing counterclockwise around the circle. From Biot-Savart's law, we can calculate φb to be 4x10^-7 T²/A². The direction of φb is perpendicular to the plane of the circle, and its angle with the z-axis is –30°. Additionally, a steady current I is flowing outward along the cylinder at r = 2m, with a current density J=0.5 Am²",
