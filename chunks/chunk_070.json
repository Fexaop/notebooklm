We have partitioned the contribution to the total magnetic field inside the sample into two parts: one, due to external factors such as the current in the solenoid. This is represented by $\\mathbf{H}$. The other is due to the specific nature of the magnetic material, namely $\\mathbf{M}$. The latter quantity can be influenced by external factors. This influence is mathematically expressed as\n\n$$\n\\mathbf {M} = \\chi \\mathbf {H} \\tag {5.13}\n$$",
