  "content": "3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that the magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast, the electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate on the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).\n\n4. A miniscule difference in the value of χ, the magnetic susceptibility, yields radically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For diamagnetic materials χ = -10⁻⁵ whereas χ = +10⁻⁵ for paramagnetic materials.",
