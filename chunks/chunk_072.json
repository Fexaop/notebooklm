  "summary": "In this passage, it is explained that a slight variation in the magnetic susceptibility, χ, causes significant differences in the behavior of materials, shifting them between diamagnetic and paramagnetic states. For diamagnetic materials, χ has a value of -10⁻⁵, while paramagnetic materials have a value of +10⁻⁵. Additionally, a perfect diamagnet, specifically superconductors, finds applications in metals at extremely low temperatures near absolute zero, around zero Kelvin (-273°C).",
