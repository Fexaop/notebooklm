  "content": "where $\\chi$, a dimensionless quantity, is appropriately called the magnetic susceptibility. It is a measure of how a magnetic material responds to an external field. $\\chi$ is small and positive for materials, which are called paramagnetic. It is small and negative for materials, which are termed diamagnetic. In the latter case $\\mathbf{M}$ and $\\mathbf{H}$ are opposite in direction. From Eqs. (5.12) and (5.13) we obtain,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} \\mathbf {B} = \\mu_ {0} (1 + \\chi) \\mathbf {H} \\tag {5.14} \\\\ = \\mu_ {0} \\mu_ {\\mathrm {r}} \\mathbf {H} \\\\ = \\mu \\mathbf {H} \\tag {5.15} \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$",
