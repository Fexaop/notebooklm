  "content": "(d) The magnetising current  $I_{M}$  is the additional current that needs to be passed through the windings of the solenoid in the absence of the core which would give a  $B$  value as in the presence of the core. Thus  $B = \\mu_r n (I + I_M)$ . Using  $I = 2\\mathrm{A}$ ,  $B = 1\\mathrm{T}$ , we get  $I_{M} = 794\\mathrm{A}$ .\n\n# 5.5 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS",
