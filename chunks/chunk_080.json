  "content": "The discussion in the previous section helps us to classify materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. In terms of the susceptibility  $\\chi$ , a material is diamagnetic if  $\\chi$  is negative, para- if  $\\chi$  is positive and small, and ferro- if  $\\chi$  is large and positive.\n\nA glance at Table 5.2 gives one a better feeling for these materials. Here  $\\varepsilon$  is a small positive number introduced to quantify paramagnetic materials. Next, we describe these materials in some detail.",
