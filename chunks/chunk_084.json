  "summary": "Diamagnetism is defined as the behaviour of an atom or a molecule with no net magnetic moment in the presence of an external magnetic field. In diamagnetism, the alignment of magnetic moments of individual atoms is negatiively affected, resulting in a slight weakening of the net magnetic moment.",
