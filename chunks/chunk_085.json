  "summary": "In the context of a magnetic field, electrons in an orbiting state are equivalent to a current-carrying loop, possessing orbital magnetic moment. The resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero in diamagnetic substances, which change their behavior differently based on the applied magnetic field.",
