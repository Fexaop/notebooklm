  "content": "Some diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon, nitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is present in all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it gets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.\n\nThe most exotic diamagnetic materials are superconductors.\n\nThese are metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both perfect conductivity and perfect diamagnetism.",
