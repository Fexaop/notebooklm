  "content": "The phenomenon of perfect diamagnetism in superconductors is called the Meissner effect, after the name of its discoverer.\n\nSuperconducting magnets can be gainfully exploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically levitated superfast trains.\n\n### 5.5.2 Paramagnetism\n\nParamagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e. they get weakly attracted to a magnet.",
