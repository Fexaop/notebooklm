  "content": "Paramagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e. they get weakly attracted to a magnet.\n\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material possess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own.",
