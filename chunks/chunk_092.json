  "content": "The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material possess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own.\n\nOn account of the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation is seen.\n\nIn the presence of an external field B_{0}, which is strong enough, and at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be made to align and point in the same direction as B_{0}.",
