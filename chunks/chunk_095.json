  "content": "Some paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium, oxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. For a paramagnetic material both χ and μ_{r} depend not only on the material, but also (in a simple fashion) on the sample temperature. As the field is increased or the temperature is lowered, the magnetisation increases until it reaches the saturation value at which point all the dipoles are perfectly aligned with the field.\n# Magnetism and Matter\n\n# 5.5.3 Ferromagnetism",

  "summary": "Paramagnetic materials, such as aluminium, oxygen, copper chloride, and calcium, have varying dependences of χ and μr on temperature and applied magnetic field. The magnetization varies from zero to saturation at a given temperature and field, with saturation occurring when all dipoles are aligned with the field.",
