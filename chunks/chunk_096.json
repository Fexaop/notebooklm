  "content": "Ferromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field. They have strong tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get strongly attracted to a magnet.\n\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material possess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material.",
