  "content": "The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material possess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material.\n\nHowever, they interact with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align themselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called domain.\n\nThe explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum mechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook.",
