  "summary": "In a linear material, the magnetization $\\textbf{M}$ is directly proportional to the externally applied magnetic field $\\textbf{H}$, with the proportionality constant being the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$. This leads to the relationship $\\textbf{B} = \\mu \\textbf{H}$, where $\\textbf{B}$ represents the magnetic field in the material, and $\\mu$ is the magnetic permeability. The magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ can be expressed as $\\chi = \\mu_r - 1$, where $\\mu_r$ is the relative magnetic permeability.",
