  "summary": "Magnetism is the ability of something to be attracted to or repelled by a magnet. It is a fundamental property of matter. The permeability of free space is the inherent property of space to support magnetic fields. Various physical quantities and their corresponding symbols, units, and dimensions are provided in a table to describe magnetism and related concepts.",
