  "content": "1. A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of moving charges/currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technological exploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific understanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is not a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science and engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in tandem.\n\n2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get two smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative charges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the electronic charge with value |e| = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C. All other charges are integral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is quantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why electric charge is quantised.",

  "summary": "Although scientific understanding of magnetism extending beyond moving charges was developed after 1800 AD, technological exploitation of its directional properties predates this understanding. Magnetic monopoles do not exist, and electric charge is quantized based on a smallest unit charge (the electronic charge).",
