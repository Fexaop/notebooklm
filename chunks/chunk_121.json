  "content": "3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that the magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast, the electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate on the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).\n\n4. A miniscule difference in the value of χ, the magnetic susceptibility, yields radically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For diamagnetic materials χ = -10⁻⁵ whereas χ = +10⁻⁵ for paramagnetic materials.",

  "summary": "The non-existence of magnetic monopoles leads to continuous magnetic field lines forming closed loops, unlike electrostatic lines that originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges. Diamagnetic materials exhibit a magnetic susceptibility of -10⁻⁵, while paramagnetic materials have a magnetic susceptibility of +10⁻⁵.",
