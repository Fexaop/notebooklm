  "content": "5.2 A short bar magnet of magnetic moment $m = 0.32 \\, \\mathrm{JT}^{-1}$ is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.15 T. If the bar is free to rotate in the plane of the field, which orientation would correspond to its (a) stable, and (b) unstable equilibrium? What is the potential energy of the magnet in each case?\n\n5.3 A closely wound solenoid of 800 turns and area of cross section $2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2$ carries a current of 3.0 A. Explain the sense in which the solenoid acts like a bar magnet. What is its associated magnetic moment?",
