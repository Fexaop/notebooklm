Explain the sense in which the solenoid acts like a bar magnet. What is its associated magnetic moment?\n\n5.4 If the solenoid in Exercise 5.5 is free to turn about the vertical direction and a uniform horizontal magnetic field of $0.25\\mathrm{T}$ is applied, what is the magnitude of torque on the solenoid when its axis makes an angle of $30^{\\circ}$ with the direction of applied field?\n\n5.5 A bar magnet of magnetic moment $1.5 \\, \\mathrm{J} \\, \\mathrm{T}^{-1}$ lies aligned with the direction of a uniform magnetic field of 0.22 T.",
